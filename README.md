# MIDAS-Massive-Image-Data-Anatomy-Spine
Low back pain is a prevalent pathology and a frequent cause of disability. It is associated with increasing costs for the health system and for society in developed countries, affecting 70% of the general population at some point in their lives, with an annual incidence of 40%. Low back pain has a tendency to become chronic or to produce relapses that can severely affect the day-to-day life of patients who suffer from it.  Identifying the prognostic factors of chronicity has become one of the priorities of researchers on lumbar pathology. In about 85% of cases it is not possible to find a precise cause of the pain. Studies that evaluate the presence of anatomical or structural changes in the lumbar spine by means such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or discography are not able to correlate these anomalies with a poor prognosis in low back pain. The concept that relates chronic pain with structural alterations must be reconsidered in view of the recent scientific evidence.
